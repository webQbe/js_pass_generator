    /*  Why Use vh?

        Using vh is especially useful for creating full-screen sections or elements 
        that need to scale with the viewport height, making it ideal for responsive 
        layouts and ensuring elements adjust smoothly to different screen sizes.

        vh stands for viewport height and is a unit that represents a percentage of 
        the viewport's height (the visible area of the browser window).

          -  1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.
          -  100vh makes an elementâ€™s height equal to the full height of the viewport.
